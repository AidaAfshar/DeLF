I want to design a recommender system for an online shopping platform. Suppose we have n products to sell on this platform. Also, there is a list of 20 features and each product has been assigned 4 features that explains the product the best. The recommender system starts to recommend products to the user one by one and the user will choose to either buy or pass the product. As the user express it's prefrence the recommender system should learn to assign products that is more likely for the user to buy. In other words, learns what features matter to the user the most.
