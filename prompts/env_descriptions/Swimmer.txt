The agent is a robot-worm that is made of three similar cylinder-like sections. These three sections are connected sequentially by two joints. The robot-worm can move by applying torque on these joints. By applying different amounts of torque, sections will form different angles with each other and let the robot-worm move on the surface. The worm is lying on a two-dimensional surface and isn't able to detach from the surface. The task for the agent is to move as far as it can during each episode. Each episode will terminate after 1000 timesteps.
