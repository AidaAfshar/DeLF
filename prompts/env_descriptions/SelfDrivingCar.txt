There agent is a self-driving car on a one-way street. The street has two lanes and some obstacles in random places. The agent can see the obstacle when it's 200 meters away from it. The agent can push the go or stop pedals in each timestep. The go pedal produces positive acceleration and the the brake pedal produces negative acceleration with the same amount. The velocity will increase/decrease according to the general laws of physics and kinematics. The agent is considered stopped when the velocity is zero.
The task of the agent is to reach a destination of 10 kilometers from its initial point while avoiding the obstacles. The agent should also stay below a specific speed limit. The episode will end if the agent hits the obstacle or reaches its destination.
